# Drag & Drop Table

This project implements a drag-and-drop table where users can move values between cells, add rows, and undo changes.

## Features
- **Drag and Drop:** Allows users to drag values from one cell and drop them into another.
- **Add Row:** Adds a new row to the table with random values and colors.
- **Undo:** Allows users to undo the last action (either adding a row or swapping values).

## Files
The project is divided into three files:
1. **index.html** - The main HTML structure of the table.
2. **styles.css** - The CSS file that styles the table and other elements.
3. **script.js** - The JavaScript file that handles the drag-and-drop functionality, row addition, and undo action.

## Project Setup

   ```bash
